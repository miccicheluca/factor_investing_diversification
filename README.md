# Study of HRP allocation process applied to factors-based portfolio


Here, you will find a quick study on the creation of a factor-based portfolio. Idea is to see if diversification can enhance the performance of a factor-based portfolio compared to an equal weighted allocation. To do so, we process first by gathering the data comming from [JKP Factors](https://jkpfactors.com/). Our data is comprised of US factor-based portfolios (*).
